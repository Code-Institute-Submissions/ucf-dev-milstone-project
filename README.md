# Super Capable

## Site Overview

There comes a time when you feel like your job is a bit stagnant, not being able to progress, doing the same thing day in day out. You professional life is boring, you need a change. 

But how can you when you are, what many might consider, too old to change your career! 

You probably heard this many times through a friend or personally that you are too late to change. You will not learn new things, will never accept told off by others lot younger than you. I know I have been there many time, yet it didn't stop me. It made me more determined to prove others wrong. 
------
This website is built for the overlooked minorities who are also majority of the working population. The over 40s that want to career change. The website will have curated articles, advice, and support for that ones who need it.

## UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

The idea to take advantage of the "Lazy coder" approach and use pre-coded core bootstrap template, snippets and libraries where possible. They will be then redesigned to fit my visual and CX (Customer Experience) requirements.

Although the project only requires HTML & CSS, I wanted to challenge myself and use bootstrap to learn how to code with it. 

Once the visitor lands on the page they are greeted with a jumbotron image and a H1 text catching their attention for what the website is all about. 

The Navbar will have three sections. About, interviews, resources, and connect with us page. 

The website will have 5 pages & sections that will include the following:
	• Home:
	• Support: A curated resources of the information that to support the SC initiative.
	• Interviews: 
	• About:
	• Connect: The contact us section of the Home page.
	• Social Media Section:

## Footer



In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
	• As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
Existing Features
	• Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
	• ...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
Features Left to Implement
	• Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
	• JQuery
		○ The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
	• HTML
	• CSS
	• Bootstrap
	• Gitpod
	• Github
	
## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Challanges:

	• First challenge I was faced with was the appearing logo. I make the mistake of not adding "assets" to the code where the image didn't show. img src="assets/images/logo.png"

	• The other challenge I had to go through was the logo design. 

	• Been trying to add the fontawesome icons with no luck where I then realised that I didn't script source into HTML.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
		1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
		2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
		3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
		4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

All the  coding is doing from Gitpod. I forked the CI template into Github and then ported it to Gitpod using the recommeded mothod. 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

	• Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
	• Different configuration files?
	• Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
